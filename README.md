# OpenCMISS-Iron tutorials

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/OpenCMISS-Iron-tutorials/badge/?version=latest)](http://OpenCMISS-Iron-tutorials.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest)

The OpenCMISS-Iron library has been created to enable highly advanced computational modelling of biological systems. It represents a re-engineering of over 30 years' of legacy codes for finite element based computational modelling of biological systems under the mast of the Physiome Project. These tutorials describe how to use OpenCMISS-Iron to solve such problems.

## Accessing the tutorial online
This tutorial is hosted on Readthedocs - https://OpenCMISS-Iron-tutorials.readthedocs.io/

## Building the tutorials locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the docs/

3. Issue the command: `make html`

4. Open the index.html file in `docs/build/` folder

## Contributing to this tutorial

1. Fork this repository to your github account.

2. Edit the restructuredText (.rst) files in the docs/sources folder (editing of these files can performed directly using the file editing tools provided by github. This will allow you to commit your changes to the repository.

3. Make a pull request from your fork to the master branch of tutorial repository in the OpenCMISS-examples organisation.

4. Your changes will be reviewed by an OpenCMISS developer and pulled into the main tutorial repository.

Over time, your fork may become out of sync with the master branch of the tutorial repository in the OpenCMISS-examples organisation. Create a pull request on your fork to pull in changes from the master branch of the tutorial respository in the OpenCMISS-examples organisation to get your fork back up-to-date. This can be performed directly on the github website.
