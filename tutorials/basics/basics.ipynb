    "# The basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to setup and solve a finite element modelling problem using OpenCMISS-Iron in python. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be solving a Laplace equation over a 1-3 dimensional domain. In mathematics and physics, Laplace's equation is a second-order partial differential equation named after Pierre-Simon Laplace who first studied its properties. In this basics tutorial, we will be making calls to the OpenCMISS-Iron's Python-bindings API to illustrate how we can interact with the library, while demonstrating the functionalities of OpenCMISS-Iron.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [OpenCMISS-Iron tutorial documenation page](https://opencmiss-iron-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#how-to-run-tutorials) for instructions on how to run this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    " - Understand how to create a problem using OpenCMISS-Iron commands.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Solve a Laplace problem using the finite element method in OpenCMISS-Iron.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Laplace problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we are solving the standard Laplace equation which is a member of the classical field equations set class and the Laplace equation type. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\nabla ^{2}f={\\frac {\\partial ^{2}f}{\\partial x^{2}}}+{\\frac {\\partial ^{2}f}{\\partial y^{2}}}+{\\frac {\\partial ^{2}f}{\\partial z^{2}}}=0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual visualisation of tutorial steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below is a conceptual visualisation of the problem set up that this tutorial will walk you through. Here are key points that will help you interpret the diagram and appreciate the steps involved in creating a problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The numbering in the figure corresponds to the steps that we will take to set up the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each box represents a type of object that will be created for the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. A box within a box represents an object that is a component of the parent object. For example, the Generated Mesh object falls within the Region object because a Generated Mesh object must be contained within a Region object. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The arrows show the inter-object relationships. For example, a Generated Mesh object is associated with a Region object but it also needs a Basis Function object. The Decomposition object can only be created if there is a Mesh object associated with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Lets define a few objects that are shown in the figure. More details about each of the objects are given as the tutorial progresses. $f$ in the laplace equation above is the *Dependent Field* that we want to solve for over the *Geometric Field* defined by $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates. To solve for $f$ we need to define the *Coordinate System*, and the *Basis Functions* we want to use as the interpolation scheme. The *Region* object is a parent environment object in which the fields, geometry of the domain and equations are defined. We need to define the *mesh* that describes the geometry that we need to solve the equations over. *Equation set* and *Equations* objects that represent the discretised form, matrix form of the finite element implementation of the laplace problem are then set up using the different fields, mesh and basis functions we have defined. The *Problem* object contains information about the solution process used to solve the equations defined in the region. *Boundary Conditions* objects contain the boundary conditions that are defined for a particular simulation."

The Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation consists of finding a solution φ on some domain D such that φ on the boundary of D is equal to some given function. Since the Laplace operator appears in the heat equation, one physical interpretation of this problem is as follows: fix the temperature on the boundary of the domain according to the given specification of the boundary condition. Allow heat to flow until a stationary state is reached in which the temperature at each point on the domain doesn't change anymore. The temperature distribution in the interior will then be given by the solution to the corresponding Dirichlet problem.\n",
