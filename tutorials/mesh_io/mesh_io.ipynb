    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will demonstrate how you can import geometric computational meshes to use for your finite element simulations. For this demonstration we will be loading in a 3D simplex tetrahedral mesh of a section of a cardiomyocyte geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "* Learn how to read in mesh files and use them to define the OpenCMISS-Iron objects that are related to mesh nodes and elements for a finite element problem.\n",
    "* Know how meshes can be output into different formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running this tutorial\n",
    "Provided that you have already installed the OpenCMISS library, the code excerpts in this section can be run interactively by entering it directly into the Python interpreter, which can be started by running python or ipython in a terminal. The code shown here can also be downloaded as a jupyter notebook in the following [link](https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/basics_tutorial/blob/master/src/python/mesh_io.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "The [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) python module is required for running this tutorial. If you are running this tutorial from an OpenCMISS-Iron docker container, then this module is already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading in a 3D tetrahedral mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will walk through the steps to load in a 3D finite element linear simplex mesh of a section of a cardiomyocyte. The filenames are `input_mesh.node` and `input_mesh.ele`. The file extensions indicate that the .node file contains nodal information and the .ele file contains element information. The mesh files contain header information in the first line and then list the mesh node and element properties, respectively .The mesh we are using in this tutorial was originally generated using a software package for creating tetrahedral meshes, called tetgen but we have stripped away some of the details to maintain the focus of this tutorial on using the OpenCMISS-Iron libraries.\n",
    "## Key concepts when loading in a mesh geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start considering importing meshes into an OpenCMISS-Iron finite element simulation keep the following points in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remember that OpenCMISS-Iron is just a library of functions to perform finite element simulations. Open-CMISS Iron does not have a pre-defined file format that it recognises. OpenCMISS-Iron is therefore mesh-file-format-agnostic. This is to say that you can import any type of file you have into the python program for your finite element simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The key step to importing meshes into your program is to write some code that enables you to import the mesh nodes and elements into aarray. This array is then used to define the Nodes and Mesh Elements objects that define a finite element mesh. The mesh format inputted is not important so long as you can use python to read that file and convert the data to a numpy array of element matrix (connectivity matrix i.e. elements and their associated nodes) and a nodal matrix (nodes and their associated x-y coordinates)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When importing meshes you need to know what type of interpolation scheme is used and then define the corresponding basis functions within the finite element program that you are using for the finite element simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Be very careful and aware of the node numbering sequence that you use to define each finite element. OpenCMISS-Iron uses the Zienkiewicz node numbering system for each element: \n",
