    "# Setting up a basic OpenCMISS-Iron problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to setup and solve a problem using OpenCMISS-Iron in python. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be solving a 2D Laplace problem. In mathematics and physics, Laplace's equation is a second-order partial differential equation named after Pierre-Simon Laplace who first studied its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided that you have already installed the OpenCMISS library, the code excerpts in this section can be run interactively by entering it directly into the Python interpreter, which can be started by running python or ipython in a terminal. The code shown here can also be downloaded as a jupyter notebook in the following [link](https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/basics_tutorial/blob/master/src/python/setting_up_basic_problem.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The laplace problem\n",
    "In this example we are solving the standard Laplace equation which is a member of the classical field equations set class and the Laplace equation type. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\nabla ^{2}f={\\frac {\\partial ^{2}f}{\\partial x^{2}}}+{\\frac {\\partial ^{2}f}{\\partial y^{2}}}=0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual visualisation of tutorial steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below is a conceptual visualisation of the problem set up that this tutorial will walk you through. Here are key points that will help you interpret the diagram and appreciate the steps involved in creating a problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The numbering in the figure corresponds to the steps that we will take to set up the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each box represents a type of object that will be created for the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. A box within a box represents an object that is a component of the parent object. For example, the Generated Mesh object falls within the Region object because a Generated Mesh object must be contained within a Region object. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The arrows show the inter-object relationships. For example, a Generated Mesh object is associated with a Region object but it also needs a Basis Function object. The Decomposition object can only be created if there is a Mesh object associated with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Lets define a few objects that are shown in the figure. More details about each of the objects are given as the tutorial progresses. $f$ in the laplace equation above is the *Dependent Field* that we want to solve for over the *Geometric Field* defined by $x$ and $y$ coordinates. To solve for $f$ we need to define the *Coordinate System*, and the *Basis Functions* we want to use as the interpolation scheme. The *Region* object is a parent environment object in which the fields, geometry of the domain and equations are defined. We need to define the *mesh* that describes the geometry that we need to solve the equations over. *Equation set* and *Equations* objects that represent the discretized form, matrix form of the finite element implementation of the laplace problem are then set up using the different fields, mesh and basis functions we have defined. The *Problem* object contains information about the solution process used to solve the equations defined in the region. *Boundary Conditions* objects contain the boundary conditions that are defined for a particular simulation.

    "The final step in configuring the problem is to define the boundary conditions to be satisfied. The Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation consists of finding a solution φ on some domain D such that φ on the boundary of D is equal to some given function. Since the Laplace operator appears in the heat equation, one physical interpretation of this problem is as follows: fix the temperature on the boundary of the domain according to the given specification of the boundary condition. Allow heat to flow until a stationary state is reached in which the temperature at each point on the domain doesn't change anymore. The temperature distribution in the interior will then be given by the solution to the corresponding Dirichlet problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "These values are set using the SetNode() method. The arguments to the SetNode() method are the field, field variable type, node version number, node user number, node derivative number, field component number, boundary condition type and boundary condition value. The version and derivative numbers are one as we aren't using versions and we are setting field values rather than derivative values. We can also only set derivative boundary conditions when using a Hermite basis type. There are a wide number of boundary condition types that can be set but many are only available for certain equation set types and in this example we simply want to fix the field value.\n",
